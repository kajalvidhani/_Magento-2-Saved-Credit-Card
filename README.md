# _Magento-2-Saved-Credit-Card
Magento 2 Saved Credit Card by Meetanshi lets customers save their credit card details in the Magento 2 database using built in encryption for offline order processing.

The default offered the feature to save credit card details in encrypted format for offline order processing. However the Magento 2 platform does not support it. To overcome this default limitation, Meetanshi has developed Magento 2 Saved Credit Card extension.

The extension allows customers to save the credit card information in the database using the Magento's built-in encryption mechanism. Use the method when you have a card terminal in a brick and mortar store or have access to a virtual terminal.

Note: It is advisable to check the PCI Compliance standard applying to your country before using the Magento 2 Saved Credit Card module.
